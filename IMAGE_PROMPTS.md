- Use the prompts above exactly as written
- Request high resolution (1024x1024 or 1920x1080)
- Specify "professional", "modern", "tech" style
- Mention "watermark rskworld.in" explicitly

### For Midjourney:
- Add style parameters: `--style raw --v 6`
- Use: `/imagine prompt: [paste prompt] --ar 16:9 --style raw`
- For watermark, add: `watermark text "rskworld.in" bottom right corner`

### For Stable Diffusion:
- Use negative prompts: `blurry, low quality, distorted text`
- Positive prompts: `high quality, professional, detailed, clean design`
- Add watermark in post-processing or use ControlNet

### For Canva / Design Tools:
1. Create base design with all elements
2. Add "rskworld.in" text in bottom right
